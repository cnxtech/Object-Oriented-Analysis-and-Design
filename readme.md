		1.) OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------

I developed these two Case Studies to introduce my students to the concept of designing and verifying their design before they wrote ANY code. 

There are three sections, the first is a UML cheat sheet that outlines the UML elements and how they are forward engineered into code (Java).

The Second and Third are Case Studies for a very basic applications(This was for Programming I)
