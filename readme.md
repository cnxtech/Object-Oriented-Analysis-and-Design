		1.) OVERVIEW
-------------------------------------------

I distilled these two Case Studies (after a series of lectures) to introduce my students to the concept of designing and verifying their design before they wrote ANY code. 

There are three sections, the first is a UML cheat sheet that outlines the UML elements and how they are forward engineered into code (Java).

The Second and Third are Case Studies for a very basic applications (This was for Programming I).

-------------------------------------------
		2.) "Fallout Message System"
-------------------------------------------

This was a step by step case study, where I outlined what was needed to discover the requirements and design elements in their software solution. 

There are three main parts to this:

1) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys.docx
2) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_Diagrams.pptx
3) OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_SourceCode.zip

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys.docx" outlines all the necessary steps for requirement discovery. 

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_Diagrams.pptx" was a student submission (that followed the .docx) that I am using with their permission (Crystal Hall). It illustrates an excellent first attept at designing before implementation. 

The "OOAD_CaseStudy_FalloutMsgSys_SourceCode.zip" is the resulting source code. 

-------------------------------------------
		3.) "Flea Circus"
-------------------------------------------

The "Flea Circus" is an implementation of a Class Diagram so the students could go back and forth and see how the Class Diagram related to the Code Implementation. 

There are a couple of parts to be aware of:

1) The .gif Class Diagram (FleaCircusClassDiagram.gif)
2) The forward-engineered code that the Class Diagram Represents.
3) The Javadocs in the "documentation" folder. Start with the index.html file.  
4) The class diagram (.uxf) was created with Umlet. It can be found here: http://www.umlet.com/changes.htm
