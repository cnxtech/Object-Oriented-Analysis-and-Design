Hi class of 218,

There are three different things to look at in this zip file:

1) The .gif Class Diagram (FleaCircusClassDiagram.gif)
2) The forward-engineered code that the Class Diagram Represents.
3) The Javadocs in the "documentation" folder. Start with the index.html file.  
4) The class diagram (.uxf) was created with Umlet. It can be found here: http://www.umlet.com/changes.htm
